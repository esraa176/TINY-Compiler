A team project to make a Compiler for TINY Programming Language with specific Programming Rules.
Only two phases are implemented; Lexical Analysis (Scanner) and Syntax Anlysis (Parser) Phases.
Scanner is implemented after going through some steps like constructing the Regular Expressions(RE), Non-Deterministic Finite Automata(NFAs) then Deterministic Finite Automata(DFAs).
Parser is implemented after going through some steps like constructing the Context Free Grammer(CFG) then eliminating Left Factoring and Left Recursion.
